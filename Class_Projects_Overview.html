    <h1> Welcome I am glad that you want to see and hear about my projects here is a summary of some of the projects that I have done.</h1>

    <p>
        
        Interactive story website I will put an image of one of the paths that you can do inside the game.  Another thing I will do is a picture of the technical code and one with the textual code.  Then I will explain the problems that I had to go through to finish the game with my teammate.  

        Board Game website I will mostly put in the code and show that the game is in progress of being fixed.  I will explain what is the problem at hand and the previous problems I have worked through
        
        Calculator that I made at the beginning of the story because it was an experience that started me coding all of the other things that I have made.  I will put the code and then I can put the working product.
