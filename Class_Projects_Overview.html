        <br>Interactive story website I will put an image of one of the paths that you can do inside the game.  Another thing I will do is a picture of the technical code and one with the textual code.  Then I will explain the problems that I had to go through to finish the game with my teammate.</br>

        <br>Board Game website I will mostly put in the code and show that the game is in progress of being fixed.  I will explain what is the problem at hand and the previous problems I have worked through</br>
        
        <br>Calculator that I made at the beginning of the story because it was an experience that started me coding all of the other things that I have made.  I will put the code and then I can put the working product.</br>
