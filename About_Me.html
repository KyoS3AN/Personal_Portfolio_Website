        Hello and thanks for visiting my digital portfolio.

        My name is Sean Smith, I will graduate from Clovis High School in 2021. At the moment I am attending the Center for Advanced Research of Technology (CART), I am attending the Web Application Development Lab, next year I will be taking the Interactive Game Design Lab that is also at CART to further my studies in Computer Engineering. Alongside schooling, I am also in boy scouts where I am an Eagle Scout.
        
        Whenever I am not studying, I am doing other minor activities such as dirtbike riding, video game playing, and puzzle-solving.  The current puzzle that I am trying to master is the Rubik cube.
        
        Please review the remainder of my personal website, which contains my resume, a cover letter, work samples, personal pages, etc. to learn more about me personally and educationally.
